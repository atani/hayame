Hayame - a lightweight video speed controller that just works.

Control playback speed on any website with simple keyboard shortcuts. No complex injection, no site-breaking hacks - just direct playbackRate control.

== Features ==

- Speed up/down in 0.1x increments
- Works on any website with HTML5 video
- Speed persists across page navigation
- On-screen indicator shows current speed
- Popup UI for quick adjustments
- Help overlay (Shift+\)
- Zero permissions beyond storage

== Keyboard Shortcuts ==

Shift+D : Speed up (+0.1)
Shift+S : Slow down (-0.1)
Shift+A : Reset to 1.0x (press again to restore previous speed)
Shift+Z : Rewind 10 seconds
Shift+C : Forward 10 seconds
Shift+\ : Toggle help overlay

Shortcuts are disabled when typing in text fields.

== Why Hayame? ==

Other speed controllers use complex injection bridges, synthetic events, and site-specific hacks that break video players. Hayame takes a different approach: it sets video.playbackRate directly. That's it. No ratechange listeners, no event synthesis, no Shadow DOM manipulation.

Simple, fast, reliable.

== Privacy ==

Hayame only uses chrome.storage.local to remember your preferred speed. No data is collected, no analytics, no network requests.
